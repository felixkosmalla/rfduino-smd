# Fritzing RFDuino part with SMD footprint
This is a Fritzing part for the RFDuino with a SMD footprint


# Attention
This is a work in progress and not yet tested. I'll remove this warning when I got a successful factory run & soldering.

* *Update 2015-08-31* The first factory run and the soldering went well. It seems to work but I didn't have time to test it fully. Programming the basic BLE Beacon examples works and is running.
